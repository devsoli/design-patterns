# Design Pattern

design pattern in software engineering is a general, reusable solution to a common problem that occurs within a given
context in software design. It's a template or blueprint for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations. Design patterns are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code. Instead, they are
descriptions or templates for how to solve a problem in a way that can be reused in many different situations.
